🟢 SECTION 1: Functions (Core Foundation)
Basic Functions

Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

Write a function that checks whether a number is even or odd.

Write a function that returns the square of a number.

What happens if a function does not return anything?

Function Expressions & Hoisting

Write a function declaration and call it before it is defined. Explain why it works.

Write a function expression and try calling it before declaration. What error do you get?

Explain the difference between function declaration and function expression with code.

First-Class Functions

Store a function inside a variable and call it.

Pass a function as an argument to another function.

Return a function from another function and call it.

Higher-Order Functions

Write a function that accepts another function and executes it.

Create a calculator function that takes an operation function (add, sub) as argument.

Identify whether a given function is first-order or higher-order.

Pure vs Impure Functions

Write a pure function that adds two numbers.

Write an impure function that modifies a global variable.

Explain why pure functions are predictable.

IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

Write an IIFE that prints “Hello JavaScript”.

Why are IIFEs used? Give one real use case.

Lexical Scope & Closures

Create a nested function and access a variable from parent scope.

Create a counter using closure.

Explain lexical scoping in your own words.

🟢 SECTION 2: Control Flow & Loops
If / Else / Switch

Write a program that prints grade based on marks.

Rewrite an if-else condition using ternary operator.

Use switch to print day names.

Loops (for / while / do-while)

Print numbers from 1 to 10 using for.

Print even numbers between 1 and 50.

Print numbers in reverse using while.

Write a do-while loop that runs at least once.

break & continue

Stop a loop when a number reaches 7.

Skip multiples of 3 in a loop.

🟢 SECTION 3: Arrays (Very Important)
Creation & Access

Create an array of numbers and print the first and last element.

Modify the third element of an array.

Looping Arrays

Print all elements using for.

Print elements using for...of.

Print index and value using forEach.

Array Methods

Use push, pop, shift, unshift on an array.

Remove specific elements using splice.

Copy part of an array using slice.

map / filter / reduce

Use map to double array values.

Use filter to get only even numbers.

Use reduce to find sum of array elements.

Use reduce to find maximum value.

Spread & Destructuring

Copy an array using spread operator.

Merge two arrays using spread.

Destructure first two elements of an array.

Sorting & Logic

Sort numbers in ascending order.

Reverse an array manually (no reverse()).

Move all zeroes to the end of array.

Find duplicate elements in an array.

Solve Two Sum problem (basic).

🟢 SECTION 4: Objects (Very Important)
Object Basics

Create an object representing a student.

Access object properties using dot and bracket notation.

Add, update, and delete object properties.

Nested Objects & Deep Access

Create an object inside another object.

Access deeply nested values.

Explain what deep access means.

Looping Objects

Loop over object using for...in.

Print keys using Object.keys().

Print values using Object.values().

Print key-value pairs using Object.entries().

Spread & Cloning

Create a shallow copy of an object using spread.

Explain difference between shallow and deep copy.

Create a deep copy using JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()).

Optional Chaining

Access deeply nested property safely using optional chaining.

Explain why optional chaining is useful.

Computed Properties

Use a variable as an object key.

Dynamically add properties to an object.

🟢 SECTION 5: Advanced but Beginner-Safe Concepts
Rest Operator

Write a function that accepts any number of arguments.

Explain difference between rest and spread operator.

Hoisting

Predict output of variables declared using var, let, const.

Explain temporal dead zone.

Truthy & Falsy

List all falsy values in JavaScript.

Predict output using truthy/falsy values.

🟢 SECTION 6: Thinking & Logic Practice (Important)

Count frequency of elements in an array.

Convert array into object with counts.

Find unique values from an array.

Flatten a nested array (basic).

Write a function that checks palindrome.

Write a function that reverses a string.

Create a mini todo list logic using arrays & objects.
